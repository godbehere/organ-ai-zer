# Caching System

Organ-AI-zer includes an intelligent caching system that stores AI suggestions to avoid redundant API calls and improve performance.

## How It Works

### üß† Smart Cache Validation
The cache automatically invalidates when:
- **Files change**: Any file is added, removed, or modified
- **Configuration changes**: AI model, organization rules, or file type settings change
- **Time expires**: Cache entries older than 10 minutes are discarded

### üíæ Dual-Layer Storage
- **Memory Cache**: Fast access for immediate `preview` ‚Üí `organize` workflows
- **Disk Cache**: Persistent storage at `~/.organ-ai-zer/cache/` for longer sessions

### üîç Cache Key Generation
Each directory gets a unique cache key based on:
- Absolute directory path
- File metadata (names, sizes, modification times)
- Configuration hash (AI settings, organization rules)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Workflow (Automatic Caching)
```bash
# First run - calls AI API
organ-ai-zer preview ~/Downloads
# ü§ñ Calling anthropic API with model claude-3-7-sonnet...
# ‚úÖ AI analysis completed with 10 suggestions
# üíæ Cached 10 suggestions in memory
# üíø Cached suggestions to disk

# Second run - uses cache
organ-ai-zer organize ~/Downloads
# üíæ Using cached suggestions from memory
# ‚úÖ Organization complete!
```

### Cache Management Commands

#### View Cache Statistics
```bash
organ-ai-zer cache stats
```
```
üìä Cache Statistics:
   Memory entries: 3
   Disk cache dir: /home/user/.organ-ai-zer/cache
```

#### Clear All Caches
```bash
organ-ai-zer cache clear
```
```
üóëÔ∏è  Cleared all caches
```

#### Clear Specific Directory Cache
```bash
organ-ai-zer cache clear -d ~/Downloads
```
```
üóëÔ∏è  Cleared cache for directory: /home/user/Downloads
```

#### Clean Expired Entries
```bash
organ-ai-zer cache clean
```
```
üßπ Cleaned expired cache entries
```

## Cache Behavior

### When Cache is Used
‚úÖ **Cache HIT** scenarios:
- Same directory scanned within 10 minutes
- No file changes (additions, deletions, modifications)
- Same configuration (AI model, organization rules)
- `preview` followed immediately by `organize`

### When Cache is Bypassed
‚ùå **Cache MISS** scenarios:
- First time scanning a directory
- Files added, removed, or modified
- Configuration changed (different AI model, organization settings)
- Cache expired (>10 minutes old)
- Manual cache clearing

### Cache Invalidation Examples

#### File Changes
```bash
organ-ai-zer preview ~/Photos  # Creates cache
# ... add a new photo to ~/Photos
organ-ai-zer organize ~/Photos # Cache miss - files changed
# üìÅ Directory contents changed
# ü§ñ Calling AI API...
```

#### Configuration Changes
```bash
organ-ai-zer preview ~/Documents  # Creates cache
# ... change AI model in config
organ-ai-zer organize ~/Documents # Cache miss - config changed  
# ‚öôÔ∏è  Configuration changed
# ü§ñ Calling AI API...
```

#### Time Expiration
```bash
organ-ai-zer preview ~/Downloads  # Creates cache
# ... wait 15 minutes
organ-ai-zer organize ~/Downloads # Cache miss - expired
# ‚è∞ Cache expired
# ü§ñ Calling AI API...
```

## Performance Benefits

### API Cost Reduction
- **Before**: Every `preview` + `organize` = 2 API calls
- **After**: First `preview` + cached `organize` = 1 API call
- **Savings**: 50% reduction in API costs for typical workflows

### Speed Improvements
- **Memory cache**: ~5ms response time
- **Disk cache**: ~50ms response time  
- **AI API call**: ~3-10 seconds response time
- **Speedup**: 100-2000x faster for cached requests

### Bandwidth Savings
- No repeated file analysis
- Reduced network traffic
- Better offline workflow support

## Advanced Usage

### Disable Caching
For testing or debugging, you can bypass cache:
```bash
# This will be implemented in future versions
organ-ai-zer preview ~/Downloads --no-cache
```

### Cache Directory Structure
```
~/.organ-ai-zer/cache/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ a1b2c3d4e5f6.json    # Cache for /home/user/Downloads
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ f6e5d4c3b2a1.json    # Cache for /home/user/Documents  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 9876543210ab.json    # Cache for /home/user/Photos
```

### Cache File Format
```json
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "file": { "path": "...", "name": "..." },
      "suggestedPath": "organized/path/file.jpg",
      "reason": "AI reasoning...",
      "confidence": 0.85
    }
  ],
  "directoryHash": "abc123...",
  "timestamp": 1640995200000,
  "fileCount": 10,
  "configHash": "def456..."
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Cache Not Working
1. **Check permissions**: Ensure write access to `~/.organ-ai-zer/cache/`
2. **Verify file stability**: Files must not change between runs
3. **Configuration consistency**: Don't modify config between `preview` and `organize`

### Cache Taking Too Much Space
```bash
# Check cache size
du -sh ~/.organ-ai-zer/cache/

# Clean old entries
organ-ai-zer cache clean

# Clear all if needed
organ-ai-zer cache clear
```

### Force Cache Refresh
```bash
# Clear cache for specific directory
organ-ai-zer cache clear -d ~/Downloads

# Then run fresh analysis
organ-ai-zer preview ~/Downloads
```

## Best Practices

### Optimal Workflow
1. **Preview first**: `organ-ai-zer preview ~/Downloads`
2. **Review suggestions**: Check the output carefully
3. **Organize immediately**: `organ-ai-zer organize ~/Downloads` (uses cache)

### Avoid Cache Misses
- Don't modify files between `preview` and `organize`
- Don't change configuration mid-workflow
- Run `organize` within 10 minutes of `preview`

### Periodic Maintenance
```bash
# Weekly cleanup (optional)
organ-ai-zer cache clean

# Monthly reset (if needed)
organ-ai-zer cache clear
```

The caching system is designed to be transparent and automatic - you don't need to think about it for normal usage, but these commands are available when you need manual control.
