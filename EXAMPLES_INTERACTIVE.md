## Tips for Successful Interactive Organization

### 1. Start with Clear Intent
- Describe the overall structure you want
- Mention specific requirements upfront
- Give examples of your preferred naming

### 2. Use the Feedback Loop Effectively
- Review the first few suggestions carefully
- Provide specific adjustments rather than complete rejection
- Build on what works, refine what doesn't

### 3. Answer Clarifying Questions
- The AI asks targeted questions to understand your needs
- Provide detailed answers to get better results
- Think about edge cases and special requirements

### 4. Test with Dry Run
- Always test complex organizations with `--dry-run` first
- Review the full plan before executing
- Make sure the structure matches your mental model

The interactive organize feature learns from your feedback and creates personalized organization structures that perfectly match your specific needs and workflow.
